          Security is important. Nobody wants to be the person advocating for
          less security. So nobody wants to say it. But somebody has to say it.
          So I guess Iâ€™ll say it. The way npm audit works is broken. Its rollout
          as a default after every npm install was rushed, inconsiderate, and
          inadequate for the front-end tooling.
